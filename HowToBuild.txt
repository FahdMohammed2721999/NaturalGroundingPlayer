Natural Grounding Player, 432hz Player and Powerliminals Player all require the 
Encoder folder to be in their runtime folder. The easiest method is to create a
junction into each runtime folder pointing to the same folder.

Open an command prompt and enter these commands:
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\NaturalGroundingPlayer\bin\Debug\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\NaturalGroundingPlayer\bin\Release\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Player432hz\bin\Debug\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Player432hz\bin\Release\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\PowerliminalsPlayer\bin\Debug\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\
mklink /J C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\PowerliminalsPlayer\bin\Release\Encoder\ C:\GitHub\NaturalGroundingPlayer\Encoder\

Compile, and run.
