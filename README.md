# Natural Grounding Player
Sequence videos based on their energy readings

The primary goal of this application is to automate Natural Grounding sessions by downloading and playing videos in the right sequence to gradually increase the intensity and bring you into higher states of consciousness. It is a spiritual awakening tool.

To learn more about Natural Grounding, you can read the <a href="https://www.shamanicattraction.com/files/ngguide2011.pdf">2011 Natural Grounding Guide</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.naturalgrounding.net/">Natural Grounding website</a>.

Natural Grounding is a very deep topic. I'm currently writing two books to properly explain what it truly is that will be published on Amazon.

## Video Optimization / Media Encoder

The secondary goal of this application is to optimize the quality of videos that you watch over and over again. It does so by helping you configure SVP and madVR for optimal playback quality. These components are very powerful but difficult to configure, and the wizard will make it easy and simple. Furthermore, the Natural Grounding Player will enable and disable these components automatically.

The media encoder is one piece of the software that will be very useful for anyone looking to increase the quality of their videos. It allows upscaling and re-encoding videos from SD to HD. It allows to convert your videos to 60fps with just a few clicks. Under the hood, it uses a combination of AviSynth, ffmpeg and x264 with a prohibitive complexity. With this Media Encoder, anyone can re-encode 50 videos in a row.
